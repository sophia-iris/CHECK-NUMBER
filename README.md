# CHECK-NUMBER

I used Thonny, a Phyton IDE. 

## How It Works
- The program allows you to check if a user enters an even or odd number.
- The function called check_number(num) will use an if-else statement to check if the number is divisible by 2 using %.
- If the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 it is an even number if it is not then it is an odd number.
- The function also work on negative numbers and zero.

## How to Run the program 
- Open Thonny.
- Run the file using the CHECK-NUMBER code.
